            <p style="font-size: small;">Having deeply felt the convenience that computer technology has brought to people’s life and witnessed how computer technology influence social revolution throughout my life experience, I determine to pursue a master’s degree in computer science/ software engineering. So that I will be able to conduct research or work in the field of computer, making contributions to social development. </p>

            <p style="font-size: small;">I grow up in a family that my father graduated from computer science major, while my mother was a law major. Under such a family environment, I have been taught to be rigorous and have innovative thinking. As a result, I am particularly interested in natural science including mathematics and physics. When I was in elementary school, I was exposed to the computer for the first time. At that time, my father bought me computer components such as CPU, motherboard, hard disk, etc., and accompanied me to assemble the host computer with the collected materials. Very enthusiastic about this, I completed this work in less than one week, though it was challenging for me. During the process, I learned the basic knowledge of computer architecture and the theoretical foundation like binary. As a little boy, I even regarded computer as a Rubik's Cube that combines all logic and ingenuity in the world. When I recall that, my interest in computers and hands-on skills has been foreshadowed since 10 years ago.</p>

            <p style="font-size: small;">Talking about Henan Province, the region my family roots in. I think it is where the most population pressure lies in China. Consequently, education resources there are particularly scarce. To be enrolled at Zhengzhou University where I attended for undergraduate education, I need to compete for more than a hundred places with one million candidates in the college entrance examination, because it is the only one “211 school” in Henna Province. Meanwhile, such an unfair competitive environment has cultivated my personality such as industrious and earnest. Moreover, it has trained me with high efficient learning strategies. From my viewpoint, that’s not a bad thing.</p>
            <p>
                &nbsp;
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: small;">Before undergraduate period, I thought computer science was an interesting subject of science, and now I understand that this subject is undertaking social ability, that is, taking effect on social quality. When I was in my junior year, I had an operation at the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University and stayed there for a week. Although the operation went smoothly and I recovered quickly, I noticed a situation that worried me more than personal safety: the hospital's wards for three people were allocated nine beds and crowded in the corridors of the hospital were full of accompanying family members. I understand there was no option due to lack of medical resources. Ironically, this situation also made the hospital known as the "largest in Asia". After returning to school, I began to think about how I could use my own power to improve that situation. It happened that the laboratory I worked at had cooperation with the First Affiliated Hospital of Zhengzhou University, so I, together with seven like-minded students, developed a mini-program based on medical knowledge graph after investigations in the hospital and learning technical knowledge. Now, the medical QA program is trying out by the hospital. Although I know that functions of the mini-program such as simple disease reasoning and popular science cannot fundamentally solve the problem of the shortage of medical resources in Henan Province, I assure that it is my social responsibility as a computer science/ software engineering major to make a slight improvement to such situations.</p>
